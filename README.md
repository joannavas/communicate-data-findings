## Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-Program
**Communicate-Data-Findings | US Flights Dataset:**

This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, we will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, we will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. The primary method of conveying our findings will be through transforming your exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.

**What do I need to install?**

This project uses Python 3 and is designed to be completed through the Jupyter Notebooks IDE. It is highly recommended that we use the Anaconda distribution to install Python, since the distribution includes all necessary Python libraries as well as Jupyter Notebooks. The following libraries are expected to be used in this project:

- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

**Why this Project?**
Data visualization is an important skill that is used in many parts of the data analysis process. Exploratory data visualization generally occurs during and after the data wrangling process, and is the main method that we will use to understand the patterns and relationships present in our data. This understanding will help us approach any statistical analyses and will help us build conclusions and findings. This process might also illuminate additional data cleaning tasks to be performed. Explanatory data visualization techniques are used after generating our findings, and are used to help communicate our results to others. Understanding design considerations will make sure that our message is clear and effective. In addition to being a good producer of visualizations, going through this project will also help us be good consumers of visualizations that are presented to us by others.

**What will I learn?**

After completing this project, we will be able to:

- Supplement statistics with visualizations to build understanding of data.
- Choose appropriate plots, limits, transformations, and aesthetics to explore a dataset, allowing us to understand distributions of variables and relationships between features.
- Use design principles to create effective visualizations for communicating findings to an audience.
